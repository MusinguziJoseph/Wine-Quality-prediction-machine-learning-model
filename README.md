# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. Using machine learning algorithms, we analyze the dataset to classify wine quality on a scale from 0 to 10. This project can be useful for winemakers and consumers alike to assess wine quality.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://MusinguziJoseph/wine-quality-prediction.git
   cd wine-quality-prediction




## Data
- The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various physicochemical properties of wine samples along with their quality ratings.
* Features:
* Fixed acidity
* Volatile acidity
* Citric acid
* Residual sugar
* Chlorides
* Free sulfur dioxide
* Total sulfur dioxide
* Density
* pH
* Sulphates
* Alcohol content
* Target:
* Quality (score between 0 and 10)
## Modeling
- We employed several machine learning algorithms to predict wine quality, including:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* The model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Results
* The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset. 
## Contributing
